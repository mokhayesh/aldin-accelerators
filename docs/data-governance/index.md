# Data Governance

Data Governance aligns people, process, and technology so data is **discoverable, trustworthy, compliant, and usable**.  
Use this page as a quick brief for stakeholders and a map to the related accelerators.

## At a glance

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-book-open-variant: **Metadata Management**  
  Build and maintain your catalog: capture technical + business metadata, lineage, and policies.

- :material-chart-bar: **Data Profiling**  
  Rapidly analyze datasets to surface structure, patterns, and outliers; inform rule design.

- :material-shield-check: **Data Quality**  
  Dimensions, rules, SLAs, monitoring, and scorecards to keep data reliable.

- :material-scale-balance: **Data Compliance**  
  Controls and policies by geography/domain (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, GLBA); automate evidence.

- :material-archive-lock: **Data Retention**  
  Lifecycle policies for archiving/disposing data; support â€œright-to-eraseâ€ requests.

- :material-account-multiple-check: **Master Data Management (MDM)**  
  Golden records for key entities; survivorship rules; improved cross-system consistency.

- :material-sitemap: **Data Architecture**  
  The technical blueprintâ€”zones, models, integrations (batch/stream/event), APIs, and IAMâ€”that
  implements governance principles and enables reusable, scalable delivery.

- :material-source-branch: **Data Lineage**  
  End-to-end traceability of data from source to consumption (technical + business lineage) for
  impact analysis, troubleshooting, and auditability.

<div class="cap-table" markdown>

| Capability / Offerings | What It Means | Whoâ€™s Involved | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Metadata Management** | Create, update, and maintain metadata (data about data); build & operate the data catalog, including policies and lineage links. | Data Steward / Catalog Manager | Enables users to find & understand data; drives self-service analytics. |
| **Data Profiling** | Sample analysis to surface structure, patterns, outliers; full-dataset assessment across dimensions (completeness, accuracy, uniqueness, validity, timeliness); custom rule definition. | Data Analyst / Steward | Quick health check; guides deeper quality efforts. |
| **Data Quality** | Dimensions, rules, thresholds/SLAs; continuous monitoring, exceptions, and scorecards. | Data Quality Lead / Engineer | Ensures analytics & ML models use reliable data; reduces risk of bad decisions. |
| **Data Compliance** | Policies & controls by geography/domain (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, GLBA). Evidence collection and attestation workflows. | Legal & Compliance Team | Avoids fines & lawsuits; supports rights to know/share/port/delete. |
| **Data Retention** | Lifecycle policies for archiving/disposing data; defensible deletion; â€œright-to-eraseâ€ requests. | Records Manager / IT | Meets legal mandates; simplifies audits and e-discovery. |
| **Master Data Management (MDM)** | Centralize & reconcile critical entity data (customers, products, suppliers). Golden record creation and survivorship rules. | MDM Lead / Architect | Single source of truth; improves cross-system consistency. |
| **Data Architecture** | Technical blueprint: domain boundaries, data zones, canonical models, integration patterns (batch/stream/event), APIs, storage, compute, and IAM guardrails that implement governance. | Data / Platform Architect, Data Engineering Lead | Provides reusable patterns and platform guardrails for **scalable, secure, cost-effective** delivery; turns policy into practice. |
| **Data Lineage** | End-to-end traceability of data (system, table, column). Technical + business lineage, change-impact analysis, and code-level drill-downs. | Data Engineer, Steward, Audit / Compliance | Builds trust and speeds issue resolution; supports audits and safe change management. |
